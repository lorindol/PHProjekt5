PHProjekt installation read me.

*******************
SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS
*******************
A webserver with a PHP4/5 parser with a connection to a database
(mysql/postgres/oracle/informix/mssql/interbase/sqlite/ibm db2).

PHProjekt works with all PHP4/5 versions. The imap library/extension
of PHP must be installed in order to use the full mail client.

A typical environment would be a LAMP (Linux/Apache/MySQL/PHP)
or WAMP (same except Windows for Linux) system. You can find
some urls for installations tutorials in the install_faq.html


****
TEST
****
If you are not sure whether your system meets the necessary
requirements you can a run script with system check:
env_test.php located in the root directory of the distribution.


*************
INSTALLATION:
*************
- Create a new blank database,
- unpack the files -be sure to leave the directory structure of the
  package- in a directory of the webserver (e.g. htdocs/phprojekt)
- call setup.php in the browser, this script will guide you through
  the rest of the installation.
- Actions during the setup: and the tables in the database will be
  created and the file config.inc.php will be written.

OR:
If you use a mysql RDBM and wish to install the tool by yourself,
download the sql dump here: www.phprojekt.com/files/sql_dump.tar.gz,
insert the dump into the database and edit the config.inc.php
according to your needs.


*******************************
UPDATE OR CONFIGURE THE SYSTEM:
*******************************
- Unpack the files in the old directory by overwriting the old files
  and run setup.php
- Actions during an update: Some tables will be created or updated
  and the file config.inc.php rewritten.
- For maintainence updates (e.g. 3.2 -> 3.2a, but NOT 3.2 -> 3.3)
  you don't neeed to call setup.php
